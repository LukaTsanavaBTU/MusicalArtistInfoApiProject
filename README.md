### MusicalArtistInfoApiProject

  This python file uses the Last.fm API to fetch information about musical artists. There are 4 main features:
    - Extracting artist info as a .json file;
    - Creating a database table and adding artist info to it;
    - Printing artinst info on the screen;
    - Cheching the status code and header info from API.
    
  You can choose which option you want to choose by typing the coresponding number(1-4) or pressing q to quit. The database file and the .json files
  are created in the same directory as the python file.
