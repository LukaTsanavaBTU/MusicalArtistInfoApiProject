### MusicalArtistInfoApiProject

  This python file uses the Last.fm API to fetch information about musical artists. There are 4 main features:
  - Extracting artist info as a .json file;
  - Creating a database table and adding artist info to it;
  - Printing artist info on the screen;
  - Checking the status code and header info from API.
    
  You can choose which option you want to choose by typing the coresponding number(1-4) or pressing q to quit. The database file and the .json files
  are created in the same directory as the python file.
